# JADE
JADE is a smart AI assistant that combines image recognition, voice commands, and hand gestures to interact with its environment. It can identify objects, provide real-time insights, and perform tasks through simple voice or gesture inputs, making it a seamless and intuitive AI companion.
source code can be modified and distributed just give everyone who contributed credit :)

# status : 
    -  incomplete
    -  GUI only for developer (future goal is to make it for the user and easy to use)
    - writes a report about what was detected and that condition or status of the object eg. person - male/female , heigth ,health  condition

# aim :
    - future versions of jade would be able to help detect any problems with primary user if needed and advice and or call for help
    -  Jade would be used as a security system that can used to set a parameter and keep you as safe as possible .jade would also serve as a task automation tool and a personal offline  assisstant whose information is only up to date to the most current version 

    -  jade should be able to be personlaised by the user even without coding experince
    - jade should be able to get trained by user through the GUI
