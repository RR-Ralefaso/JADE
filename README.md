# JADE (Joint Artificial Digital Entity)

**JADE** is a smart AI assistant that combines **image recognition**, **voice commands**, and **hand gestures** to interact with its environment. It identifies objects, provides real-time insights, and performs tasks through seamless, intuitive inputs.

## 🛠 Project Status
* **Status:** Incomplete / In Development
* **Interface:** Current GUI is developer-focused (Future goal: User-friendly consumer GUI).
* **Reporting:** Currently generates reports on detected objects including status details (e.g., Person: gender, height, health condition).

---

## 🚀 The Vision (Project Goals)

* **Personal Health & Safety:** Future versions will detect issues with the primary user and offer advice or call for emergency help.
* **Smart Security:** A perimeter-based security system designed to keep the user safe.
* **Offline Assistant:** A task automation tool that works locally to ensure privacy and speed.
* **No-Code Customization:** Users should be able to personalize and train JADE directly through the GUI without needing to write code.
